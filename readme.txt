UDP file transfer
Simulate sending of a text file using a UDP segment over a UDP socket.

Put all files to one directory on cse machine.
Type "make" to run makefile.
After makefile runs, UDP server and client will be compiled.
The executable files called "userver" and "uclient".
Use ./userver <Port Number> and ./uclient <Port Number> <filename> to run them.
The server should run on cse03.cse.unt.edu machine and the client should run on cse02.cse.unt.edu machine
Run userver and uclient with a same valid port number.
After using the program, you can use "make clean" to remove all executable files.
